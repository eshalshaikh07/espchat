# ESP32 Firebase Messaging Example

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple messaging system between two ESP32 boards using Firebase Realtime Database. One ESP32 can send messages to Firebase, while the other can receive and display these messages in real-time.

## Features

- Send messages from ESP32 to Firebase Realtime Database.
- Receive and display messages on another ESP32 from Firebase.
- Uses HTTPClient for HTTP requests and ArduinoJson for JSON parsing.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed.
- ESP32 development board.
- WiFi network credentials.
- Firebase Realtime Database project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/esp32-firebase-messaging.git
